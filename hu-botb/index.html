      <b>Meet NFL4U</b>
      <p>
        Two-hundred and fifty-nine student-athletes were drafted in the 2021 NFL draft. Out of all the student-athletes drafted, not one of them attended an HBCU. This has been a continuing problem for over a decade.  Due to a lack of NFL career opportunities, HBCU students are not exposed to all that the NFL has to offer. Meet NFL4U, a website that has the platform to bridge the gap between the NFL and HBCUs around the country. NFL4U allows students and HBCU alumni to have a personalized experience of connecting with NFL opportunities through its employees and its players. As of 2020, only 70% of NFL players are African American, 10% of those players in the Pro Football Hall Of Fame attended HBCUs. NFL4U will bring to light the hidden talent of athletes that attend HBCUs through the website by exposing the students to NFL information and all its benefits. Despite the NFL players being 70% black, there is a lack of representation behind the careers that have high influence. As of 2022, there are only five black general managers who work for the NFL, none of which attended an HBCU.  NFL4U exposes non-athlete students interested in working for the NFL to job opportunities of their desire. The roles of the front office for each individual team have a direct influence on the direction of the NFL. As of today, there are no black NFL owners, and this causes a ripple effect of lack of representation behind the scenes, including reaching out to HBCUs to find talent for NFL careers. NFL4U exposes the careers to aspiring general managers, programmers, developers, and all of the off-field careers NFL has to offer to HBCU students.</p>
      <b>What Is NFL4U?</b>
      <p>
        NFL4U is a collaborative website that eliminates barriers and forms connections between HBCU students/alumni and the National Football League. The goal is to create a network of opportunities for HBCU students to get hired into various NFL careers. NFL4U is a component of the league and serves as a networking service specifically for HBCU students and alumni seeking roles within the NFL and for current employees of the NFL looking to hire for open positions. The program focuses on professional development, connections, and opportunities. One of the components focuses on upskilling. The website allows users to access NFL resources that are designed to train prospective job candidates for the role, as well as providing a line of communication through recruiters and the user. Within this segment, NFL4U provides a direct campus connection to the NFL. The website focuses on forming connections that will be attained through a sponsorship and mentorship approach for users. The websiteâ€™s artificial intelligence quiz will provide the user with various options of an NFL career path based on their interest. NFL employees are also able to take this quiz to match a prospective user with them to establish a mentor/sponsor relationship. NFL4U provides information for career football forums, experienceships, and social impact workshops, as well as information on the current NFL teams and their players. Athletes interested in the website will be able to gain access to information on NFL football players and use this information to shape their own HBCU football experience. Not only will the website provide insight into the lives of NFL players, but it will also provide information on other NFL careers, including project management, NFL owners, general management, marketing, and more.
